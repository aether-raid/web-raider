{"question_title": "What is the fastest way to get the value of \u03c0?", "question_body": "I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of \u03c0, as a personal challenge. More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using #define constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in. The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest. Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c): #include <math.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <time.h> #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) { \\ diff = 0.0; \\ time1 = clock(); \\ for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) \\ diff += (x) - M_PI; \\ time2 = clock(); \\ printf(\"%s\\t=> %e, time => %f\\n\", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1)); \\ } static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0) { return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; } int main() { int i; clock_t time1, time2; double diff; /* Warmup.

{"question_title": "How do you sort a dictionary by value?", "question_body": "I often have to sort a dictionary (consisting of keys & values) by value. For example, I have a hash of words and respective frequencies that I want to order by frequency. There is a SortedList which is good for a single value (say frequency), that I want to map back to the word. SortedDictionary orders by key, not value. Some resort to a custom class, but is there a cleaner way?", "model_answer": "## Sorting a Dictionary by Value in Python\n\nSorting a dictionary by value is not a straightforward task in Python because dictionaries are inherently unordered data structures. However, we can use the `sorted()` method to achieve this.\n\n### Direct Answer\nTo sort a dictionary by its values, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):\n    return dict(sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))\n```\n\nThis function takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with the items sorted by their values.\n\n### Explanation\n\nAccording to the search results, we need to use the `sorted()` method to sort the dictionary items. The `sorted()` method returns a new list containing all items from the dictionary in ascending order of their values.\n\nWe can specify a custom sorting key using the `key` parameter. In this case, we want to sort by the value (the second element of each item), so we use `item[1]` as the key.\n\nFinally, we convert the resulting list back into a dictionary using the `dict()` constructor.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 8}\nsorted_dict = sort_dict_by_value(my_dict)\nprint(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'banana': 2, 'apple': 5, 'cherry': 8}\n```\n\nIn this example, the dictionary is sorted by its values in ascending order.\n\n### Parameters of the `sorted()` Method\n\nThe `sorted()` method takes several parameters that can be used to customize the sorting behavior. These include:\n\n*   `key`: A function that takes a list item and returns a value that will be used for sorting.\n*   `reverse`: A boolean indicating whether to sort in ascending or descending order.\n\nFor more information on the `sorted()` method, see [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSorting a dictionary by its values can be achieved using the `sorted()` method and a custom sorting key. This approach returns a new dictionary with the items sorted in ascending order of their values.\n\nBy following this example, you should be able to sort dictionaries by value in your own Python code.", "model_answer_score": 92.5}

CCNET is configured to create a build on every check in. CCNET uses MSBuild to build the source code. I would like to use the latest revision number to generate AssemblyInfo.cs while compiling. How can I retrieve the latest revision from subversion and use the value in CCNET? Edit: I'm not using NAnt - only MSBuild.", "model_answer": "## Direct Answer to Main Question\n\nTo use SVN Revision to label build in CCNET, you can utilize the SVN Revision Labeller available on Google Code. This labeller allows you to incorporate the Subversion revision number into your build process.\n\n## Explanation and Support from Search Results\n\nAccording to the search results, there are several ways to achieve this goal. One approach is to use the LastChangeLabeller in CCNET, which can retrieve the SVN revision number. However, as mentioned in one of the related questions, \"My ultimate goal is to format the build number with both a build number (incrementing by 1) and the subversion revision.\" To accomplish this, you may need to combine the LastChangeLabeller with another labeller or use an external tool.\n\n## Solution: SVN Revision Labeller\n\nThe SVN Revision Labeller seems to be the most suitable solution for incorporating the SVN revision number into your build process. According to one of the answers:\n\n\"I found a duplicate question. Use svn revision to label build in ccnet. This lead me to svnRevisionLabeller available on Google Code This seems to be the best solution for me.\"\n\nThis labeller allows you to customize the version number format, which can include both the SVN revision and an incrementing build number.\n\n## Modifying the Labeller\n\nIf needed, you can modify the code of the SVN Revision Labeller to suit your specific requirements. For example, if you want the subversion revision number to be the last number in the version number (major.minor.build.revision), you can make the necessary adjustments as mentioned in one of the answers:\n\n\"I modified the code slightly because I wanted the subversion revision number to be last number in the version number. major.minor.build.revision. This labeller by default does major.minor.revision.build.\"\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo use SVN Revision to label build in CCNET, you can utilize the SVN Revision Labeller available on Google Code. This solution allows you to incorporate the Subversion revision number into your build process and customize the version number format as needed.\n\n### Example Code Snippet (NAnt Build File)\n\n```xml\n<target name=\"svninfo\" description=\"get the svn checkout information\">\n  <property name=\"svn.infotempfile\" value=\"${build.directory}\\svninfo.txt\" />\n  <exec program=\"${nant.svn.exe}\" dir=\"${source.code.dir}\" output=\"${svn.infotempfile}\">\n    <arg line=\"/version\"/>\n  </exec>\n  <!-- parse svn info and create properties -->\n</target>\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve SVN information using an NAnt build file.

Where would you suggest I start? The XML files I'll be building will be fairly simple.", "model_answer": "## Dealing with XML in Python: A Simple Approach\n\nThere are several ways to deal with XML documents in Python, but finding a \"really simple\" way can be subjective. According to the search results, one approach is to use the built-in `xml` module, specifically `xml.parsers.expat`, which provides a low-level SAX-like parser interface (1).\n\nHowever, another option is to use the DOM API for Python, which is a widely used XML interpretation system and should be robust (2). This might be more complicated than what you're looking for, but it preserves all the information implicit in XML markup.\n\nIf you want something even simpler, consider using the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module, which provides an easy-to-use API for parsing and manipulating XML documents. According to the search results, this is a good choice if you need to parse an XML file and manipulate its contents (3).\n\nFor example, let's say we have the following XML document:\n```xml\n<root>\n    <person>\n        <name>John</name>\n        <age>30</age>\n    </person>\n    <person>\n        <name>Jane</name>\n        <age>25</age>\n    </person>\n</root>\n```\nWe can parse this document using `xml.etree.ElementTree` like so:\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\ntree = ET.parse('example.xml')\nroot = tree.getroot()\n\nfor person in root.findall('person'):\n    name = person.find('name').text\n    age = person.find('age').text\n    print(f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\")\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nName: John, Age: 30\nName: Jane, Age: 25\n```\nAnother option is to use the `simplexml` module, which is a small wrapper around `ElementTree`. According to the search results, this module provides an easy-to-use API for parsing and manipulating XML documents (4).\n\nIn conclusion, there are several ways to deal with XML documents in Python, ranging from low-level parser interfaces like `xml.parsers.expat` to high-level APIs like `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `simplexml`. The choice of which one to use depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your XML documents.\n\n## References:\n\n(1) According to the search results, \"A low-level SAXlike parser interface provides a Pythonic object interface to the parsed XML document\" (1).\n\n(2) According to the search results, \"If you haven't already, I'd suggest looking into the DOM API for Python.

{"question_title": "How do I use itertools.groupby()?", "question_body": "I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's itertools.groupby() function. What I'm trying to do is this: Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified lxml element Divide it into groups based on some criteria Then later iterate over each of these groups separately. I've reviewed the documentation, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. So, how do I use of itertools.groupby()? Is there another technique I should be using? Pointers to good \"prerequisite\" reading would also be appreciated.", "model_answer": "## Using `itertools.groupby()`\n\nThe `itertools.groupby()` function is a powerful tool in Python for grouping elements of an iterable based on a key function.\n\n### Direct Answer\nTo use `itertools.groupby()`, you need to provide it with an iterable and a key function that determines the group each element belongs to. The function will then yield tuples containing the key value and an iterator over the elements in the group.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   **Key Function**: The key function is used to determine the group each element belongs to. It should return a value that can be compared with other values.\n*   **Grouping**: `itertools.groupby()` generates a new group every time the value of the key function changes.\n*   **Iterating Over Groups**: After grouping, you can iterate over each group using the iterator returned by `groupby()`.\n*   **Example**:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\n# Example list of children of an objectified lxml element\nchildren = ['child1', 'child2', 'child3', 'child4']\n\n# Key function to determine the group based on some criteria (e.g., alphabetical order)\ndef key_func(child):\n    return child[0]\n\n# Grouping the children using itertools.groupby()\ngrouped_children = groupby(sorted(children), key_func)\n\n# Iterating over each group\nfor key, group in grouped_children:\n    print(f\"Group: {key}\")\n    for child in group:\n        print(child)\n```\n\n### Additional Information\n\n*   **Sorting Before Grouping**: In the example above, we sorted the list of children before grouping them. This is because `itertools.groupby()` requires the input iterable to be sorted by the key function.\n*   **Iterating Over Groups**: After grouping, you can iterate over each group using the iterator returned by `groupby()`. Each iteration yields a tuple containing the key value and an iterator over the elements in the group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n`itertools.groupby()` is a versatile tool for grouping elements of an iterable based on a key function. By understanding how to use this function, you can efficiently process large datasets and perform complex data analysis tasks.\n\nAccording to the search results, `itertools.groupby()` is often used in conjunction with other functions from the `itertools` module, such as `sorted()`, to achieve more complex grouping operations.\n\n### References\n\n*   [How do I use itertools.groupby()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4353747/how-do-i-use-itertools-groupby)\n*   [Python itertools groupby not grouping as I expect](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4353747/python-itertools-groupby-not-grouping-as-i-expect)", "model_answer_score": 92.5}

What causes it and how do I fix it?", "model_answer": "**Fixing 'Unprocessed view path found' error with ExceptionNotifier plugin in Rails 2.1**\n\nThe 'Unprocessed view path found' error occurs when the ExceptionNotifier plugin is unable to find the correct view paths in your Rails application after upgrading from Rails 1.2 to 2.1.\n\n**Causes of the Error:**\nAccording to the search results, this issue arises because the ExceptionNotifier plugin relies on the observer pattern, which has changed significantly between Rails 1.2 and 2.1. The plugin's notification system is not compatible with the new observer pattern in Rails 2.1.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo fix this error, you need to set your view paths correctly using `append_view_path`, `prepend_view_path`, or `view_paths`. This can be done by modifying the ExceptionNotifier configuration in your application.\n\n```ruby\n# config/initializers/exception_notifier.rb\n\nExceptionNotifier.append_view_path \"/path/to/appname/vendor/plugins/exception_notification/lib/../views\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `prepend_view_path` to add the view path at the beginning of the list:\n\n```ruby\nExceptionNotifier.prepend_view_path \"/path/to/appname/vendor/plugins/exception_notification/lib/../views\"\n```\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Make sure that your ExceptionNotifier configuration is correctly set up in your application.\n* Verify that the view paths are correctly defined and accessible by the ExceptionNotifier plugin.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the 'Unprocessed view path found' error with the ExceptionNotifier plugin in Rails 2.1.", "model_answer_score": 92.5}
