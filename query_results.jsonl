More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using #define constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in. The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest. Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c): #include <math.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <time.h> #define ITERS 10000000 #define TESTWITH(x) { \\ diff = 0.0; \\ time1 = clock(); \\ for (i = 0; i < ITERS; ++i) \\ diff += (x) - M_PI; \\ time2 = clock(); \\ printf(\"%s\\t=> %e, time => %f\\n\", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1)); \\ } static inline double diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0) { return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC; } int main() { int i; clock_t time1, time2; double diff; /* Warmup.

{"question_title": "How do you sort a dictionary by value?", "question_body": "I often have to sort a dictionary (consisting of keys & values) by value. For example, I have a hash of words and respective frequencies that I want to order by frequency. There is a SortedList which is good for a single value (say frequency), that I want to map back to the word. SortedDictionary orders by key, not value. Some resort to a custom class, but is there a cleaner way?", "model_answer": "## Sorting a Dictionary by Value in Python\n\nSorting a dictionary by value is not a straightforward task in Python due to the lack of an inbuilt method for this operation. However, we can achieve this using the `sorted()` function.\n\n### Direct Answer\nTo sort a dictionary by its values, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):\n    return dict(sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))\n```\n\nThis function takes a dictionary as input and returns a new sorted dictionary based on its values. The `sorted()` function is used with a lambda function as the `key` argument to specify that we want to sort by the dictionary's values.\n\n### Explanation\n\nAccording to the search results, Python doesn't have an inbuilt method for sorting dictionaries by value [1]. However, we can use the `sorted()` function to achieve this. The `items()` method of a dictionary returns a list of its key-value pairs, which we can then sort using the `sorted()` function.\n\n### Parameters of the sorted() Method\n\nThe `sorted()` function takes an iterable as input and returns a new sorted list. In our case, we pass the dictionary's items to it. The `key` argument is used to specify that we want to sort by the dictionary's values. We use a lambda function to extract the value from each item.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere's an example of using this function:\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 8}\nsorted_dict = sort_dict_by_value(my_dict)\nprint(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'banana': 2, 'apple': 5, 'cherry': 8}\n```\n\nIn this example, the dictionary is sorted by its values in ascending order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSorting a dictionary by value can be achieved using the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the `key` argument. This approach allows us to sort dictionaries based on their values without having to rely on any external libraries or complex algorithms.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] According to the search results, Python doesn't have an inbuilt method for sorting dictionaries by value [1].", "model_answer_score": 92.5}

Where would you suggest I start? The XML files I'll be building will be fairly simple.", "model_answer": "## Dealing with XML in Python: A Simple Approach\n\nThere are several ways to deal with XML documents in Python, but one of the simplest approaches is using the built-in `xml` module, specifically `xml.parsers.expat`. According to the search results, this module provides a low-level SAX-like parser interface that offers a Pythonic object interface to the parsed XML document.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nTo demonstrate how to use `xml.parsers.expat`, consider the following example:\n\n```python\nimport xml.parsers.expat\n\n# Parse an XML string\nxml_string = \"\"\"\n<root>\n    <person>\n        <name>John</name>\n        <age>30</age>\n    </person>\n</root>\n\"\"\"\n\nparser = xml.parsers.expat.ParserCreate()\nparser.Parse(xml_string, True)\n```\n\n### Handling Complex XML Structures\n\nHowever, dealing with complex XML structures can be more challenging. In such cases, using a library like `xml.etree.ElementTree` (also known as `ElementTree`) can simplify the process.\n\nAccording to the search results, `ElementTree` is a widely used and robust XML interpretation system that provides an easy-to-use API for parsing and manipulating XML documents.\n\n### Example Usage with ElementTree\n\nHere's an example of using `ElementTree` to parse an XML string:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Parse an XML string\nxml_string = \"\"\"\n<root>\n    <person>\n        <name>John</name>\n        <age>30</age>\n    </person>\n</root>\n\"\"\"\n\nroot = ET.fromstring(xml_string)\n\n# Accessing elements and attributes\nprint(root.find('person').find('name').text)  # Output: John\n```\n\n### Generating XML from Python Data\n\nAnother common task when working with XML is generating an XML string from Python data. According to the search results, libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree` can be used for this purpose as well.\n\nHere's an example of generating an XML string from a Python dictionary:\n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET\n\n# Create a Python dictionary\ndata = {\n    'name': 'John',\n    'age': 30,\n}\n\n# Generate an XML string\nroot = ET.Element('person')\nET.SubElement(root, 'name').text = data['name']\nET.SubElement(root, 'age').text = str(data['age'])\n\nxml_string = ET.tostring(root, encoding='unicode')\n\nprint(xml_string)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDealing with XML in Python can be simplified by using the built-in `xml` module or libraries like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.

However, database updates are still done manually in this scenario.\n\nAnother method involves using Ant (cross-platform) for scripting and Subversion for the source repository. This allows for backing up the existing DB schema before making changes.\n\n### Tracking DDL Changes\n\nDDL (Data Definition Language) changes alter the structure of the database (e.g., creating or altering tables). To track these changes, it's essential to keep DDL and DML (Data Manipulation Language) changes separate to simplify tracking and application. According to the search results, this can be achieved by using a version control system for database structure changes.\n\n### Automating Testing for Schema Changes\n\nAutomated tests should be created to verify that schema changes don't break existing functionality. A testing environment that closely resembles the production environment is necessary for testing schema changes.\n\n### Continuous Integration and Deployment\n\nContinuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be set up to automate database updates, ensuring that changes are properly tracked and tested before being deployed to production.\n\n### Example Tools and Technologies\n\nSome tools and technologies mentioned in the search results include:\n\n* Phing: A build tool for automating tasks\n* DBDeploy: A tool for managing database schema changes\n* Ant: A cross-platform scripting tool\n* SVN (Subversion): A version control system\n* Git: A distributed version control system\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTracking and automating DB schema changes is crucial for maintaining a stable and efficient database.

Pointers to good \"prerequisite\" reading would also be appreciated.", "model_answer": "## Using `itertools.groupby()`\n\n`itertools.groupby()` is a powerful tool in Python's standard library for grouping iterable elements into tuples based on a key function.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nThe basic syntax of `groupby()` is as follows:\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef key_func(element):\n    # Define the key function to determine the group\n    pass\n\niterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor key, group in groupby(iterable, key_func):\n    print(key, list(group))\n```\nAccording to the search results, this is a good starting point for understanding how `groupby()` works.\n\n### Key Function\n\nThe key function is crucial in determining which elements are grouped together. It should return a value that can be used as a key for grouping.\n```python\ndef key_func(element):\n    return element % 2  # Group even and odd numbers separately\n```\nAccording to the search results, the key function can be any callable that takes one argument.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose we have a list of students with their ages:\n```python\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 20},\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 22},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 20},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 21}\n]\n```\nWe can use `groupby()` to group the students by their age:\n```python\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef key_func(student):\n    return student[\"age\"]\n\nstudents.sort(key=key_func)\nfor key, group in groupby(students, key_func):\n    print(f\"Age {key}:\")\n    for student in group:\n        print(student[\"name\"])\n```\nAccording to the search results, this is a good way to demonstrate how `groupby()` can be used with custom data structures.\n\n### Handling Multiple Values\n\nIf we have multiple values that need to be considered when grouping elements, we can use a tuple as the key.\n```python\ndef key_func(element):\n    return (element % 2, element % 3)  # Group by both even/odd and remainder of 3\n```\nAccording to the search results, this is a common pattern when working with multiple values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n`itertools.groupby()` is a versatile tool for grouping iterable elements into tuples based on a key function. By understanding how to use `groupby()` effectively, we can write more efficient and readable code.\n\nReferences:\n\n* [How do I make a flat list out of a list of lists?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952725/how-to-make-a-flat-list-out-of-a-list-of-lists)\n* [How do I use itertools.groupby()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576113/how-do-i-use-itertools-groupby)\n* [What is keyfunc used for in Python's itertools.groupby() documentation?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576121/what-is-keyfunc-used-for-in-pythons-itertools-groupby-documentation)", "model_answer_score": 92.5}

Set your view paths with #append_view_path, #prepend_view_path, or #view_paths=. What causes it and how do I fix it?", "model_answer": "**Fixing 'Unprocessed view path found' error with ExceptionNotifier plugin in Rails 2.1**\n\nThe 'Unprocessed view path found' error occurs when the ExceptionNotifier plugin is unable to find the required view paths in your Rails application. This issue arises after upgrading from Rails 1.2 to 2.1.\n\n**Causes of the Error:**\nAccording to the search results, this error is caused by an invalid view path being found by ActionView::TemplateFinder. Specifically, it mentions that the plugin is looking for views in \"/path/to/appname/vendor/plugins/exception_notification/lib/../views\".\n\n**Fixing the Issue:**\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to set your view paths correctly using `#append_view_path`, `#prepend_view_path`, or `#view_paths=`. This can be done by modifying the ExceptionNotifier plugin's code.\n\nAccording to the search results, you should \"Set your view paths with #append_view_path, #prepend_view_path, or #view_paths=\".\n\nHere is an example of how you might modify the ExceptionNotifier plugin's code:\n\n```ruby\n# In exception_notification.rb (inside vendor/plugins/exception_notification/lib/)\nmodule ExceptionNotification\n  class << self\n    def append_view_path(path)\n      # Append the view path to the existing paths\n      ActionView::TemplateFinder.append_view_path(path)\n    end\n\n    def prepend_view_path(path)\n      # Prepend the view path to the existing paths\n      ActionView::TemplateFinder.prepend_view_path(path)\n    end\n\n    def view_paths=(paths)\n      # Set the view paths directly\n      ActionView::TemplateFinder.view_paths = paths\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy setting your view paths correctly using `#append_view_path`, `#prepend_view_path`, or `#view_paths=`, you should be able to resolve the 'Unprocessed view path found' error with the ExceptionNotifier plugin in Rails 2.1.\n\nNote that this solution assumes you have access to modify the ExceptionNotifier plugin's code. If not, you may need to contact the plugin author for further assistance.", "model_answer_score": 85.0}
